## BIO
<p align="left"><small>
I am having bachelor <b>(B.CS)</b> and master <b>(M.CS)</b> degrees of Computer Science. I am currently pursuing a <b>PhD</b> degree on Computer Science at University of Arkansas.
I am a software engineer/developer since <b>2004</b>. I had been in various positions including software developer, project manager, software development leader and software architect as an industrial experience.
After having an industrial experience i decided to return to an academic study in order to move forward in the field of my passion which is Deep Learning. Additionally I am really interested in
interpreting data with Artificial Intelligence <b>(A.I.)</b> and Machine Learning <b>(M.L.)</b> techniques/algorithms to open a new era for future works. Also, i am a freelance developer and an entrepreneur for my own applications.
